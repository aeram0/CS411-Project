Idea 1: The perfect travel destination
1) You input budget, weather of preference, location and time.
2) We would figure out destinations that fit your budget.
APIs used: weather, currency, flights, location, possibly a Geonames API

Idea 2: Finding events near you
1) You input your location and things you're interested in (artists, types of events, etc)
2) We then cross-check with your google calendar to see when you are available to go to a certain event
Ex: "hey we saw that you're free on Friday 5-7pm, and there's an event 5 miles away from you that we think you'd like."
APIs used: google calendar, weather, location, an API for events(like eventbrite or whatever)
